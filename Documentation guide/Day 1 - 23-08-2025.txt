##  Architecture & Design Patterns

### MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern
The application follows the MVC architectural pattern:

- **Models** (`/models/`): Define data structures and database schemas
- **Views** (`/views/`): Handle presentation layer with EJS templates
- **Controllers** (`/routes/`): Manage application logic and user interactions

### File Structure
```
fitness-tracker/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js                 # Main server file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                   # Environment variables
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ User.js           # User schema with auth methods
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Workout.js        # Workout and exercise schemas
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth.js           # Authentication routes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workouts.js       # Workout CRUD operations
â”œâ”€â”€ views/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/             # Login and registration pages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workouts/         # Workout management pages
â””â”€â”€ public/
    â”œâ”€â”€ css/style.css     # Custom styling
    â””â”€â”€ js/               # Client-side JavaScript
```

##  Database Schema

### User Model
```javascript
{
  username: String (required, unique),
  email: String (required, unique, lowercase),
  password: String (required, hashed),
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Workout Model
```javascript
{
  name: String (required),
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  exercises: [ExerciseSchema],
  totalTime: Number (seconds),
  completed: Boolean,
  createdAt: Date,
  completedAt: Date
}
```

### Exercise Schema (embedded)
```javascript
{
  name: String (required),
  sets: Number (default: 3),
  reps: Number (default: 10),
  weight: Number (default: 0),
  restTime: Number (default: 60 seconds)
}
```

##  Authentication System

### Security Features
- **Password Hashing**: Uses bcryptjs with salt rounds
- **Session Management**: Express-session with secure cookies
- **Route Protection**: Middleware checks for authenticated users
- **Input Validation**: Basic form validation on client and server

### Auth Flow
1. User registers â†’ Password hashed â†’ Session created
2. User logs in â†’ Password compared â†’ Session established
3. Protected routes check session â†’ Redirect if not authenticated
4. Logout destroys session

##  Core Functionality

### 1. Workout Creation
- **Exercise Autocomplete**: Dropdown suggests from 25+ common exercises
- **Dynamic Forms**: Add/remove exercises with real-time form generation
- **Exercise Parameters**: Sets, reps, weight, rest time for each exercise
- **Form Validation**: Required fields and number constraints

### 2. Workout Timer System
The timer system is the most complex feature with multiple states:

#### Timer States
- **Stopped**: Initial state, ready to start
- **Running**: Workout timer counting up
- **Paused**: Timer stopped but can resume
- **Resting**: Between-set rest period countdown

#### Timer Features
- **Main Timer**: Tracks total workout duration
- **Exercise Progress**: Shows current exercise and set
- **Rest Timer**: Countdown between sets with skip option
- **Visual Progress**: Progress bar showing workout completion
- **Exercise Navigation**: Highlights current/completed exercises

### 3. Workout Management
- **Dashboard**: View all workouts with status indicators
- **Workout Details**: View exercise breakdown and workout info
- **Start/Complete**: Launch timer or mark as completed
- **Delete**: Remove unwanted workouts with confirmation

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Dynamic Form Generation
The workout creator uses JavaScript to dynamically generate form fields for exercises. Each exercise gets a unique ID and proper form array naming for server processing.

### 2. Exercise Suggestion System
- Predefined array of 25+ common exercises
- Real-time filtering based on user input
- Click-to-select functionality
- Keyboard navigation support

### 3. Complex Timer Logic
The workout timer manages multiple concurrent states:
- Total workout time (always counting when active)
- Current exercise and set tracking
- Rest period countdowns
- Visual progress indicators
- State persistence for pause/resume

### 4. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first CSS approach
- Bootstrap grid system for layout
- Custom media queries for timer display
- Touch-friendly button sizing

### 5. Data Validation
- Client-side: HTML5 form validation + JavaScript
- Server-side: Mongoose schema validation
- User feedback: Error messages and success indicators

## User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- **Loading States**: Button states during form submission
- **Progress Indicators**: Workout completion progress bar
- **Status Badges**: Completed/active workout indicators
- **Color Coding**: Success (green), warning (yellow), danger (red)

### Interactive Elements
- **Hover Effects**: Cards lift slightly on hover
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions for state changes
- **Real-time Updates**: Timer updates every second
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Delete confirmations prevent accidents

### Mobile Optimization
- **Responsive Timer**: Large, readable timer display on mobile
